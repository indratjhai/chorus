/**
 * Wrap a command in a PTY using `script` so the child sees stdout as a TTY.
 *
 * Why opencode needs this: opencode 1.14.x's `run --format json` calls
 * isatty(stdout) before emitting any output. When stdout is a pipe (which
 * is always true under our spawnHeadless path), it produces zero bytes —
 * the model still runs to completion (visible in opencode's debug log)
 * but nothing reaches our parser. PTY wrapping is the only known fix
 * short of upstream patching opencode.
 *
 * Cross-platform notes:
 *   - Linux (util-linux script ≥2.39): `script -qfec "<quoted>" /dev/null`
 *     -q suppresses header/footer, -f flushes after every write (no JSON
 *     buffering), -e forwards the child's exit code so cli_failed
 *     detection still works, -c runs a single command instead of a shell.
 *   - macOS (BSD script): `script -q /dev/null <cmd> <args...>` — the
 *     command is positional, no -c, no -f (BSD script always flushes).
 *   - Anywhere else (Windows, missing `script`): pass through unwrapped.
 *     The reviewer runner's "no events at all" safety net (added in the
 *     same fix) will surface a `## REVIEWER FAILED · no_output` instead
 *     of a silent 0-byte answer.

  //
  // OpenCode 1.14.x shows a TWO-STEP dialog when the user picks "Allow always":
  //   1. First dialog (3 buttons, default = leftmost "Allow once"):
  //          Allow once   Allow always   Reject
  //      → `Right` moves the highlight from "Allow once" to "Allow always".
  //      → `Enter` confirms and pops the second dialog.
  //   2. Nested confirm (2 buttons, default = leftmost "Confirm"):
  //          △ Always allow
  //          This will allow the following patterns until OpenCode is restarted:
  //          - cat *
  //          Confirm   Cancel
  //      → `Enter` confirms (default selection is "Confirm"). Dialog dismisses.
  //
  // Earlier `[Right, Enter]` only cleared step 1; step 2 sat there forever, the
  // detector's dedup suppressed re-emission of `permission_prompt` (same kind),
  // and the reviewer phase eventually timed out with no answer. Worse: if the
  // dedup ever cleared (e.g. pane redraw scrolled "Always allow" off-screen)
  // and a fresh recovery fired on dialog 2, `Right` would move "Confirm" →
  // "Cancel" and `Enter` would REJECT the command. This sequence sends all
  // three keys atomically via a single `tmux send-keys` call — bubbletea
  // queues them and processes one at a time, so even if dialog 2 hasn't
  // rendered yet when the third Enter arrives, it's queued and consumed when
  // the input loop next polls.
  //
  // Same dialog shape covers every recoverable opencode prompt we've seen
  // (git diff, Read on external path, Task subagent spawn). If a future
  // opencode reorders buttons or adds a step 3, this sequence may fail
  // safely (extra Enters land as harmless newlines in chat input) — phase
