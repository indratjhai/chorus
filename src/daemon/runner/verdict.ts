/**
 * Reviewer-text → verdict heuristic.
 *
 * Reviewers don't return a structured boolean; they write English. This
 * tries to extract `approve / request-changes / null` from their final
 * answer.md, scanning the tail first (where verdicts typically live)
 * before falling back to the whole text. Word-boundary regex matches
 * avoid false positives like "approached" → approve.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   true   = reviewer approved
 *   false  = reviewer disagreed / requested changes
 *   null   = ambiguous (caller should treat as failed/inconclusive)
 *
 * The 80-char floor protects against `## DONE`-only answers being
 * counted as ambiguous-empty rather than auto-failures upstream.
